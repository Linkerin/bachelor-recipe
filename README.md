## About 👨‍💻 <a id="about"></a>

[The Bachelor Recipe](https://recipes.snipshot.dev) is your source of tasty and easy cooking recipes. Anyone can cook these dishes, regardless of their culinary skills.

The website started as a fun project to get acquainted with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Time passed and it has grown into something much more meaningful.

I like the idea that it can be used by other solo chefs, and it's also a great place for me to store my own recipes, which I occasionally forget.

## Technologies used ⌨️ <a id="technologies"></a>

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
  for a performant and light-weight frontend.
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) for an easy-to-use and reliable hosting.
