## Cooking

1. In a stockpot, bring _200 ml_ of water to a boil.

2. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and then gradually whisk in the coarsely ground cornmeal.

3. Allow the cornmeal to cook for about 2 minutes, and when it starts to thicken, add the remaining water.

4. Continue whisking as you cook the mixture. After approximately 3 minutes,
   add the milk and add the unsalted butter.

5. Simmer the mixture for an additional 10 minutes, ensuring to stir occasionally.
   If it becomes too thick, you can adjust the consistency by adding a bit more milk.

6. Taste the polenta and season with salt as needed.

7. Remove the pot from heat and gently stir in the grated cheddar and parmesan cheeses
   until they melt and create a creamy texture.

Serve the polenta immediately. Keep in mind that it cools rapidly. It pairs wonderfully with ham.
