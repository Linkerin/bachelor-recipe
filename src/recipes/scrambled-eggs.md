- 50 grams of butter
- Salt, pepper, to taste

## Cooking

1. Take a non-stick skillet and place it over medium heat. Add the butter and let it melt.

2. While the butter is melting, crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them thoroughly.
   The mixture should be smooth and uniform, without any translucent streaks of egg whites.

   > **Helpful tip**: Instead of butter, you can use olive oil, which will impart a slightly different flavor.  
   > Additionally, for a creamier texture and milder egg taste, you can add up to 50 ml of heavy cream to the egg mixture.

3. Once the butter has completely melted in the skillet, pour in the beaten egg mixture and gently stir in the melted butter with a spatula.
   Cook over low to medium heat, do not rush.

4. During the cooking process, be sure to periodically (every 30 seconds - 1 minute) stir the mixture,
   scraping any bits that stick to the bottom of the skillet.

5. After 7-10 minutes, the mixture will transform from a liquid to a thick creamy consistency.
   Remove the skillet from the heat and season with salt, pepper, and any other desired spices to taste.

6. Let the scrambled eggs sit in the skillet for about a minute to finish cooking.
   Keep in mind that they cool quickly, so ensure the rest of your breakfast is ready for a delightful meal.

Creamy scrambled eggs pair wonderfully with avocado and a few slices of salted salmon for a delicious and fulfilling breakfast.
