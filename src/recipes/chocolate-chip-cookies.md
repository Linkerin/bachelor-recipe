## Ingredients

- 225 grams of butter
- 275 grams of all-purpose flour
- 120 grams of brown sugar

- 2 large eggs
- 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon of salt
- 160 grams of chocolate, chopped or in chips

## Cooking

1. Ensure that the eggs and unsalted butter have reached room temperature.

2. Chop the chocolate into small pieces or use chocolate chips.

3. In a spacious mixing bowl, blend the butter and sugars until the mixture is smooth. Then, gently fold in the eggs.
   The resulting mixture should have a slightly liquid consistency.
   You can gently warm it in the microwave for about a minute or in the oven for 2-3 minutes if necessary.

4. Sift the flour into the mixture, add salt, and baking soda.

5. Knead the dough until it reaches a uniform. Add the chocolate and slightly mix.

6. Place the dough in the freezer for 1 hour.

7. Preheat the oven to 190째C (375째F), and prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper and greasing it lightly.

8. Retrieve the chilled dough from the freezer. Form small portions of the dough into your preferred cookie size
   and arrange them on the prepared baking sheet. We recommend using 2 tablespoons of dough for a piece.
   Keep in mind that the cookies will expand to about one and a half times their original size as they bake.

9. Bake for 15 minutes at 190째C (375째F). The edges should take on a delicate golden hue
   while the tops maintain a slightly lighter appearance.

   > **A crucial tip**: do not overbake the cookies. They may appear slightly doughy at this stage, and that's absolutely perfect. This is the secret to their irresistibly soft and chewy texture.

10. Remove the warm, freshly baked cookies from the oven and let them cool to room temperature.
    Once they have cooled, you can store them in an airtight container.
