## Ingredients

- 800 grams of cream cheese (e.g. _Philadelphia_)
- 400 ml of whipping cream (30-35% fat)
- 180 grams of brown sugar _(regular white sugar is also fine)_
- 5 large eggs
- 30 grams of all-purpose flour

## Cooking

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C / 428°F (or 200°C / 392°F fan), with heat from both the upper and lower elements.

2. Prepare a cake tin at least 20 cm deep. You'll need 2 large sheets of baking paper: lay them on top of each other in an "X" shape. Press the parchment into the tin, ensuring it covers the corners and extends above the rim. The creases in the paper will give the cheesecake its unique look.

3. Start by beating the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth and creamy.

   > **Helpful tip**: Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature by taking them out of the fridge in advance.

4. Add the sugar into the soft cheese and beat them together until the grains of sugar dissolve.

5. Add the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.

6. Pour in 1/4 of the cream and add the flour. Mix until smooth and free of lumps. Then, add the remaining cream and mix well.

7. Pour the mixture into the prepared cake tin. To remove air bubbles, tap the tin on the counter and use a small sharp knife to pop any bubbles that rise to the surface. Repeat this process 2-4 times.

8. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes. The surface colour will tell when it’s done: the top should be deeply caramelized (brown / golden, but _not_ burnt), and the center should remain wobbly while the cake puffs up like a soufflé.

9. Turn of the oven, open the door, and let the cheesecake cool completely in the tin for 2-3 hours. The cake will sink as it cools.

10. Put the cheesecake in the fridge and chill it for at least 1 hour before serving.
