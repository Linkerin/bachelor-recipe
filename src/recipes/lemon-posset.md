## Ingredients

- 90 grams of sugar
- 500 ml of heavy cream (22% fat)
- 2 medium-size lemons

## Cooking

1. Begin by grating the zest from two medium-sized lemons, which should yield approximately 2 tablespoons of zest.

2. Squeeze the juice from the same two lemons and set it aside.

3. In a saucepan, gently bring 17 fluid ounces of heavy cream to a simmer over low heat. Once it starts to simmer,
   add the lemon zest and sugar, pour in the squeezed lemon juice, and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer.

4. Slowly stir the mixture while it simmers for about 5-7 minutes.
   This will infuse the cream with the bright and zesty lemon flavor.

5. Remove the mixture from the heat. Strain out and discard the lemon zest.

6. Pour the lemon posset into serving dishes, such as glass or porcelain cups or bowls.

7. Allow the posset to cool to room temperature. Once it has reached room temperature,
   place the serving dishes in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours.

When serving, you can garnish with a touch of fresh berries.
