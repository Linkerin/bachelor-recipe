## Ingredients

- 100 ml of carbonated (sparkling) water
- 1 medium or large egg

- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 2 tablespoons of sugar
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil

## Cooking

1. In a large mixing bowl combine the salt, baking soda, citric acid (or lemon juice), and carbonated water.

   > **Helpful tip**: If you don't have carbonated water on hand, you can dissolve the baking soda
   > and citric acid with 50 ml of regular water and then add 50 ml of milk instead.

2. Add the sugar, one-third of the flour, and a bit of milk to the mixture.
   Begin stirring until you achieve a smooth, uniform consistency.
   Incorporate the remaining flour and milk gradually. It'll be easier to mix this way.

3. Once you've blended in all the flour and milk, crack the egg into the batter and add the olive oil.
   Stir until you have a thick, lump-free batter.  
   The resulting batter should be thick, not watery. If it easily drips off a spoon,
   add a bit more flour (20-30 grams) and mix thoroughly.

4. Heat a dry skillet over medium heat, **no need for oil**.

5. Using a spoon, pour out portions of the batter onto the skillet,
   creating pancakes approximately 9 cm in diameter.

6. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then flip the pancake and cook the other side for 1.5-2 minutes more.
   You'll know it's time to flip when small bubbles form all over the surface of the pancake.

The pancakes are ready to be served! Savor them and enjoy with your choice of maple syrup,
jam, honey, berries, or whipped cream according to your taste.
