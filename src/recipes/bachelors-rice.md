## Ingredients

- 160 grams of whole grain (integral) rice
- 600 grams of pork or chicken breast
- 450 ml of water

## Cooking

1. Thoroughly rinse the whole grain rice through a sieve or in a pot,
   changing the water several times.

2. Place the rinsed rice in a pot, add 450 ml of water,
   and bring it to a boil over high heat. Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to medium.

3. Cut the pork or chicken breast into small pieces (approximately 3 cm) and add it to the pot.

4. Dice the onion, tomatoes, and sweet pepper into small pieces, then put them into the pot.

5. Add the olive oil, curry powder, salt, pepper, and other desired seasonings.

6. Stir the contents of the pot, cover with a lid, and let it simmer over medium heat for 30-40 minutes.
   Most of the liquid should evaporate, but be sure to avoid burning.
   Regularly stir the mixture to ensure even cooking.

7. When there's only a little liquid left in the pot, sprinkle the grated cheese,
   stir, and cook for an additional 3 minutes.

The Bachelor's Rice is now ready to be served.
