## Cooking

1. Pour in a saucepan the whole milk, add the oat flakes, and toss in the raisins.

2. Place the saucepan over high heat and bring the milk to a gentle boil.

   > **Be careful**, the milk can boil over quickly!

3. Once the milk starts to simmer and rise, reduce the heat to medium
   and continuously stir to prevent any spillover.

4. Allow the porridge to simmer gently over medium heat for 20-25 minutes.
   Stir periodically (every 3-5 minutes).

5. When the porridge thickens and shows the first signs of sticking to the bottom,
   add the butter and mix.

6. Continue to cook the porridge for 3 minutes more, stirring regularly.

Your oatmeal porridge with raisins is ready and you can start your breakfast.
