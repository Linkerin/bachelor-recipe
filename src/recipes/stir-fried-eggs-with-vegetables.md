## Ingredients

## Cooking

1. Finely dice the onions.

2. Pour olive oil into the skillet and add the diced onions.
   Thoroughly stir with a spatula and cook over medium heat.

3. Dice the ripe tomatoes into small cubes. For the best flavor, opt for the juiciest tomatoes.
   Meanwhile, occasionally stir the onions.

4. Allow the onions to caramelize and develop a rich, golden hue. Add the diced tomatoes and the butter,
   stirring well. Cover the skillet with a lid.

5. Crack the eggs into a bowl and lightly beat them.
   It's perfectly fine if the mixture isn't completely uniform.

6. After 5 minutes of cooking, when some of the liquid starts evaporating, pour in the beaten eggs
   and immediately start stirring vigorously for 2-3 minutes.

7. Sprinkle the grated cheese over the mixture, stir,
   and continue cooking with the lid on for a minute.

8. In just a minute, your dish is ready. Turn off the stove and serve.

The dish goes beautifully with ripe avocado. You should try it for breakfast.
